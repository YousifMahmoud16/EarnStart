                <ul>
                    <li>Some platforms may ask for ID if suspicious activity is detected or if you request large
                        payouts.</li>
                    <li>To avoid issues, use your real email and be honest when filling out profiles.</li>
                    <li>If you're under 18, make sure to check each platform’s age requirement.</li>
                </ul>
